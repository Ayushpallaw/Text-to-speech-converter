# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter(Built with Python and Tkinter)
A simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter that converts text into natural-sounding speech.



## Project Overview  
This project is a simple **Text-to-Speech Converter** built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to input text and convert it into speech using the `pyttsx3` library. The GUI provides an intuitive interface for seamless text-to-audio conversion.

## Objectives  

### User Interface:  
- Create a simple and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter.
- Provide an input text box where users can enter text.
- Include a button to convert text to speech and play the audio.
- Add an option to adjust speech rate and volume.

### Functionalities:  
- Convert user-inputted text into speech using `pyttsx3`.
- Allow customization of voice properties such as rate and volume.
- Provide clear instructions for ease of use.
- Ensure smooth playback of the generated speech.

## Key Insights  
- The project uses **Tkinter** for the GUI and **pyttsx3** for text-to-speech conversion.
- The layout is designed with the **Grid Geometry Manager** for better alignment.
- Users can **adjust the speech rate and volume** for a personalized experience.
- The application supports multiple **voices (male/female)**, depending on system configurations.
- Error handling is implemented to prevent crashes due to invalid input.

## Recommendations  

### UI Enhancements:  
- Improve UI with custom styling for a modern look.
- Add an option to change voice (male/female).

### Functionality Improvements:  
- Implement a feature to save the generated speech as an **audio file (MP3/WAV)**.
- Allow users to **copy-paste text** into the input field.
- Add support for **multiple languages**.

### Code Optimization:  
- Structure the code using an **object-oriented approach**.
- Separate GUI and logic into different files for maintainability.

## Conclusion  
The **Text-to-Speech Converter** built with Python and Tkinter provides a simple yet effective way to convert text into speech. With future enhancements such as audio file saving, multi-language support, and a refined UI, it can be expanded into a more feature-rich application. This project is a great example of using Python for **GUI-based speech applications**.
